## General

* Please use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and open root repository folder in VSCode. This will ensure you get the correct extensions for PowerShell (and the its script analyzer) and basic spell check. It will also correctly format the ps1 files when you save them.
* Please resolve any warnings or errors reported by PSScriptAnalyzer in VSCode for the files you are updating, or add suppression and justification on why to ignore it. For more info on this see <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/utility-modules/psscriptanalyzer/using-scriptanalyzer?view=ps-modules#suppressing-rules>
